# Change Review

This skill is a read-only task mode. It inherits the active task boundary and
does not authorize file changes, approval, publication, or other external
effects.

## Inputs

- active task and acceptance criteria;
- applicable root-to-leaf instructions;
- exact changed files, patch, or artifact version; and
- validation evidence and known limitations.

## Workflow

1. Restate scope, revision, authority boundary, and exclusions.
2. Inspect changed behavior and affected callers.
3. Trace each acceptance criterion to implementation and evidence.
4. Test assumptions and relevant negative cases.
5. Report findings in severity order.
6. If no findings exist, say so explicitly and list residual test gaps.

## Evidence labels

- Observed: supported directly by implementation, configuration, or output.
- Inferred: consequence supported by a stated reasoning chain.
- Unverified: plausible concern blocked by missing evidence.

## Output

Each finding includes stable ID, severity, exact location, evidence, impact,
smallest safe remedy, and disposition owner. Do not report style preferences
as correctness defects.
