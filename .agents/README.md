# Capability Packages

This plural `.agents/` tree contains discoverable agents, skills, and
workflows. The singular `.agent/` tree remains the live governance and state
plane.

Capabilities inherit and may narrow the current task's authority. They cannot
expand permission, approve their own work, or bypass kernel policy and
validation. The included packages are unadopted reference capabilities until
the project reviews their scope, provenance, commands, and maintainers.

Agent, workflow, and skill-provenance JSON records conform to
`.agent/schemas/harness-capability-records.schema.json`. Their
`adoption_status`, provenance review fields, and `permission_grant: false`
remain explicit. Skill discovery metadata uses only `name` and `description`
in `SKILL.md` frontmatter; package version and review state live in the
closed `references/provenance.json` capability provenance record. Adoption
requires an accepted decision reference but still cannot create permission.
