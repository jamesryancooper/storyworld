# Supply Chain, Dependencies, Vendors, and Licenses

## Applicability assessment

- Status: `not_assessed`
- Triggers: external code, packages, models, content, datasets, vendors, or
  services
- Assessed on: not assessed
- Assessor and basis: not assessed

Record the durable assessment on conceptual type `SUP-0001` in the artifact
registry. `applicable` or `not_applicable` requires `assessed_on`,
`assessed_by`, and a rationale; retain a not-applicable type record after
removing its physical representation.

If a trigger applies, inventory exact sources and versions, licenses and
rights, trust and update assumptions, vulnerabilities, local modifications,
and verification. Generate an SBOM from declared dependency sources where
practical; do not edit a generated SBOM independently.
