# Authority and Precedence

This file explains how to interpret Storyworld Platform project material. It does
not create permission.

## Precedence

1. Current user, platform, tool, contractual, and legal constraints.
2. Applicable repository instructions.
3. Live project policy and accepted project-specific decisions.
4. Executable or operational evidence for current-state claims.
5. Canonical dossier material for intended state.
6. Current-state and conformance records.
7. Plans, registers, and handoff views.
8. Provenance, historical material, and generated reports.

## Conflict rule

Current behavior does not become the intended target merely because it exists.
Target documentation does not prove implementation. Unresolved conflicts must
be recorded as findings or open questions.

## Representation authority

- `machine-readable/artifact-registry.json` is the project-local edit source
  for artifact types, physical representations, applicability, owners, review
  state, and source direction.
- `ARTIFACT_CATALOG.json` and
  `machine-readable/path-authority.json` are generated mirrors.
- `MANIFEST.json`, `CHECKSUMS.sha256`, and harness integrity reports are
  point-in-time generated evidence.
- In Minimal, human-readable requirements, findings, plans, registers, and
  provenance pages may own their records. In Standard and High-Assurance, the
  corresponding JSON stores own individual records and Markdown owns method,
  vocabulary, and explanation.
- A generation date is scaffold provenance. It is not a review date,
  observation date, approval, or freshness claim.
