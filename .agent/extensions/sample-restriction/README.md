# Sample Restriction Extension

This packaged, domain-neutral reference extension demonstrates the stable
extension protocol. It is disabled because generation cannot adopt its code
or transfer a trust decision. When deliberately adopted, it can only add path
restrictions, has no external side effects, and grants no permission.

Enable it only after recording an accepted, externally grounded decision and
setting `trust_decision_ref`. The registry may return `enabled` to `false`;
the kernel remains valid and does not require code changes. Replace or remove
this extension during project-specific adoption only after the disable-path
test continues to pass.
