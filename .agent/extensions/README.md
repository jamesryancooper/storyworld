# Project Extensions

Extensions own domain registries, build or release rules, and project-specific
validators. The governance kernel stays domain-neutral.

Each extension declares compatibility, config, validator, owner, provenance,
side effects, deprecation, and `authority_effect: restrictions_only`. It may
add restrictions and checks but cannot grant permission or weaken the kernel.
Disabling it must leave the kernel valid.
