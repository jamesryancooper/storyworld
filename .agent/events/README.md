# Event Records

Events are append-only JSON Lines records of meaningful lifecycle transitions,
approvals, validation outcomes, external effects, and recovery points. They
are chronology, not detailed evidence and not a command transcript.

Create `events.jsonl` when the first real event occurs. Each nonblank line must
be one JSON object matching `.agent/templates/event.json`. Never fabricate a
bootstrap event merely to populate the file.

If validation reports a corrupt line, preserve the original file as recovery
evidence, identify the last valid line, restore from the recorded checkpoint
or version-control history, and append a recovery event. Do not silently delete
or rewrite valid prior events.
