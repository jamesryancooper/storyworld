# Generated Integrity

Files in this directory are derived, non-authoritative, and point-in-time.
They never grant permission or prove project readiness.

`refresh.py` validates managed sources before staging every profile-applicable
derived output. It then replaces only the declared derived paths. The dossier
catalog, path-authority map, and manifest share one generation ID in every
profile. High Assurance additionally writes `manifest.json`,
`validation-report.json`, and dossier checksums in the same transaction.

Because ordinary filesystems cannot replace several files atomically, an
interruption can leave a mixed generation; the final read-only check rejects
that state and any abandoned `.refresh-*.tmp` staging directory. Inspect an
abandoned directory only for diagnosis—authoritative content is never staged
there—then rerun refresh to recover and rerun the check.

Checksums or fingerprints prove byte consistency within their declared scope,
not correctness, security, freshness, provenance, approval, or legal rights.
